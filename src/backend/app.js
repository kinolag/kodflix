const express = require('express')

/*

This app starts a server and listens on port 3000 for connections. The app responds with “Hello World!” for requests to the root URL (/) or route. For every other path, it will respond with a 404 Not Found.

The example above is actually a working server: Go ahead and click on the URL shown. You’ll get a response, with real-time logs on the page, and any changes you make will be reflected in real time. This is powered by RunKit, which provides an interactive JavaScript playground connected to a complete Node environment that runs in your web browser. Below are instructions for running the same app on your local machine.

RunKit is a third-party service not affiliated with the Express project.
